# The Erlking Game

This is a short text and audio based adventure game that I made for my high school music theory class, based off of Franz Schubert's 
song "Erlk√∂nig". 

For this project, I used only html, css, javascript, and jquery. In addition, I made all of the buttons and menu bars in photoshop, and 
the characters were made from images that I found online and then photoshopped to fit in.

The webpage for the game can be found [here](https://buonuomo.github.io/erlking-game/) (NOTE: does not work on mobile)
